# Samplify

Built at the Monthly Music Hackathon at the Spotify headquarters, Samplify allows users to get 30 second previews of songs and quickly add the ones they like to their Spotify playlist.

The app was built using Rails, JavaScript, and Materialize.  Additional features include Spotify OAuth, which allows users to add songs directly to their Spotify account.
